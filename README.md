To create a build

	grunt build



For local testing, create a local.json (same level as package.json) file to contain the environment variables.

    {
    "PORT": 4321,
    "DEBUG": "*",
    "NODE_ENV": "development"
    }

Then you can proceed with npm as expected.


    npm install
    npm run start
